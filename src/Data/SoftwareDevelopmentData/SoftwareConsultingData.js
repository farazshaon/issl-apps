        "Businesses often treat symptoms instead of addressing the actual cause of a problem. For instance, a high abandonment rate in the customer service contact center might be perceived as a shortage of personnel when the actual problem could be related to other factors such as poor system response, necessary information not readily available, incorrect information displayed or in wrong sequence, employees at fax machine, etc. Our experience and focus allows us to zero in on the real issues causing the problem and our software consultants can recommend the appropriate business software solution",

      description:
        "Knowing the source of a business problem is not enough. Proper problem resolution requires an in depth understanding of the effects of the problem, either in terms of value (amount) or opportunity. Problem resolution decisions should always be based upon some tangible benefit such as increased profits, improved customer loyalty, or some other strategic objective. To accomplish this you will need a reasonable idea of the cost/value of the problem. ISSL has performed cost/benefit studies for many of its clients. ",

        "After the nature and scope of the problem have been identified, it is time to evaluate and select a methodology for resolution. In some cases the cost/benefits might outweigh the problem, in which case the decision will be easy: do nothing. In most cases, however, this is where an experienced consultant can be most beneficial. ISSL can assist you in the evaluation and selection of software solutions, technology and hardware solutions, and process enhancement strategies. ISSLâ€™s broad based experienced allows us to identify which solutions will be most appropriate for your business problem.
